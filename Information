//There will be more files that will be added to this repository later, but these are the scripts I have made so far.
//I have only started the development on my game yesterday so keep that in mind.
//These scripts are intended to be used on sprites in unity.
//Just import the .cs files as assets into unity and drag and drop them onto a gameObject name "Player"
